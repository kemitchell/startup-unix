# Startup Legal is Unix All Over Again

Startup legal structure is stuck in the Unix era, waiting for its "open" moment.

Every startup company has to run boring "business applications". Employees want stock options with standard tax benefits. Investors want a structure they can model. The guy in the tie at the bank won't give you a bank account without the right magic paper. Boring.

There are probably dozens of prepackaged legal form sets for starting and "booting up" a Silicon Valley style startup company. All of them are compatible with these and other basic, boring "business applications", with a little headroom for customization. The set you're running probably reflects who is selling you other kinds of products and services.

It's like that ancient program that accounting ran on the mainframe in the basement of your old job. AIX? Solaris? Who cares?

Vendors care. They probably sold accounting the mainframe, and the mainframe almost certainly runs "their" Unix. The army of consultants and technicians and training people in orbit around the vendor all know that Unix like the backs of their hands, in every gruesome detail and glorious selling point. It isn't so much that customers buy Such-and-Such Unix and try to think up things to run on it. They know what they need, compare a few to get it, and buy a solution as much for the follow-on companies, experts, and products as any intrinsic feature.

When you go to a startup-capable law firm and get yourself a corporation, you end up with the same basic Delaware corporation as everyone else. It's commodity legal hardware. But your Delaware corporation comes preloaded with the law firm's operating system, in the form of articles of incorporation, bylaws, basic agreements, and other documents. Those docs pick the ground rules and set the board for the business game that follows.

The lawyers at the firm know their "flavor" of startup legal down cold. The 409A valuation firms they refer know where to look for the parts they need. The form financing documents they have ready to go are built to run on them. There may even be some document preparation automation going on back office.

A good form set produces a legally compliant, business-ready corporation every time. That is the vast majority of its value. But that isn't to say all form sets are created equal. They are products of the institutions that make them. If a firm has particular strength in, say, tax, its startup forms may end up with more nuanced tax features. If the firm forms a lot of startups for foreign founders, its forms may better address immigration issues. If the firm has an active form revision committee, or a particularly dedicated "startup" partner, updates for changes in the law may land quicker. Each little island makes beads and baskets in its own special way.

## The Law First Standard Distribution

It's not quite as bad as that. Startup legal has had its BSD moment.

A number of very fine law firms now release snapshots of at least part of their in-house forms on the Internet. As far as I know, Orrick blazed the trail, followed eventually by Cooley, Gunderson, Perkins Coie, and probably others.

Anyone can download the latest Orrick/Cooley/Gunderson/PK Distribution. It may not be easy to use, complete, or particularly up-to-date. But the industry is richer for having the information. It's good education for budding businesspeople and lawyers. If you're familiar with the forms---many startup lawyers can "recognize" a law firm in the style of a company's founding docs---it can save you time reviewing for meaningful changes.
