# Startup Legal is Unix All Over Again

Startup legal structure is stuck in the Unix era, waiting for its "open" moment.

Every startup company has to run boring "business applications". Employees want stock options with standard tax benefits. Investors want a structure they can model. The guy in the tie at the bank won't give you a bank account without the right magic paper. Boring.

There are probably dozens of prepackaged legal form sets for starting and "booting up" a Silicon Valley style startup company. All of them are compatible with these and other basic, boring "business applications", with a little headroom for customization. The set you're running probably reflects who is selling you other kinds of products and services.

It's like that ancient program that accounting ran on the mainframe in the basement of your old job. AIX? Solaris? Who cares?

Vendors care. They probably sold accounting the mainframe, and the mainframe almost certainly runs "their" Unix. The army of consultants and technicians and training people in orbit around the vendor all know that Unix like the backs of their hands, in every gruesome detail and glorious selling point. It isn't so much that customers buy Such-and-Such Unix and try to think up things to run on it. They know what they need, compare a few to get it, and buy a solution as much for the follow-on companies, experts, and products as any intrinsic feature.

When you go to a startup-capable law firm and get yourself a corporation, you end up with the same basic Delaware corporation as everyone else. It's commodity legal hardware. But your Delaware corporation comes preloaded with the law firm's operating system, in the form of articles of incorporation, bylaws, basic agreements, and other documents. Those docs pick the ground rules and set the board for the business game that follows.

The lawyers at the firm know their "flavor" of startup legal down cold. The 409A valuation firms they refer know where to look for the parts they need. The form financing documents they have ready to go are built to run on them. There may even be some document preparation automation going on back office.

A good form set produces a legally compliant, business-ready corporation every time. That is the vast majority of its value. But that isn't to say all form sets are created equal. They are products of the institutions that make them. If a firm has particular strength in, say, tax, its startup forms may end up with more nuanced tax features. If the firm forms a lot of startups for foreign founders, its forms may better address immigration issues. If the firm has an active form revision committee, or a particularly dedicated "startup" partner, updates for changes in the law may land quicker. Each little island makes beads and baskets in its own special way.

## The Law Firm Standard Distribution

It's not quite as bad as that. Fortunately, startup legal has had its BSD moment.

A number of very fine law firms now release snapshots of at least part of their in-house forms on the Internet. As far as I know, Orrick blazed the trail, followed eventually by Cooley, Gunderson, Perkins Coie, and probably others.

Anyone can download the latest Orrick/Cooley/Gunderson/PK Distribution. It may not be easy to use, complete, or up-to-date, but the community is better off for the information. It's good education for budding businesspeople. It's invaluable for up-and-coming lawyers. And if you're familiar with the forms---many startup lawyers can "recognize" a law firm in the style of a company's founding docs---it can even save you time reviewing for meaningful changes. As a practicing attorney, I've no doubt the process of preparing the forms for publication benefited the forms and the firms' own clients, too.

And they've seeded some meaningful innovation. The Orrick set, for example, begat Clerky, which in turn begat a bevy of startups. Gunderson's release of its documents on Docracy was a boon. Legal technology startups and open-source projects love to demo with startup documents, because they're just so easy to get.

## Over the Wall

The Law Firm Standard Distributions are fundamentally read-only. Each firm has its own internal revision process, and those processes are time-intensive and expensive. Their output alone is tremendously valuable, but there's no clear channel for outside feedback or interaction, and no good incentive for it to begin with. To land a patch upstream to the law firm, you go to work for the law firm and take it up to the committee or partner who tends the templates.

Of course, you're free to "fork" your own variant of a publicly released set. What happens next? Either you revisit each of your changes every time the firm makes a new release, or you give up and go you own way. The proliferation of "house" form sets at law firms may come right down to lawyers carrying their old "house" set with them as they changed law firms.
