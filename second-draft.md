# Startup Legal is Unix All Over Again

Startup legal structure is stuck in the Unix era, waiting for its "open" moment.

Every startup company has to run boring "business applications". Employees want stock options with standard tax benefits. Investors want a structure they can model. The guy in the tie at the bank won't give you a bank account without the right magic paper. Boring.

There are probably dozens of prepackaged legal form sets for starting and "booting up" a Silicon Valley style startup company. All of them are compatible with these and other basic, boring "business applications", with a little headroom for customization. The set you're running probably reflects who is selling you other kinds of products and services.

It's like that ancient program that accounting ran on the mainframe in the basement of your old job. AIX? Solaris? Who cares?

Vendors care. They probably sold accounting the mainframe, and the mainframe almost certainly runs "their" Unix. The army of consultants and technicians and training people in orbit around the vendor all know that Unix like the backs of their hands, in every gruesome detail and glorious selling point. It isn't so much that customers buy Such-and-Such Unix and try to think up things to run on it. They know what they need, compare a few to get it, and buy a solution as much for the follow-on companies, experts, and products as any intrinsic feature.

When you go to a startup-capable law firm and get yourself a corporation, you end up with the same basic Delaware corporation as everyone else. It's commodity legal hardware. But your Delaware corporation comes preloaded with the law firm's operating system, in the form of articles of incorporation, bylaws, basic agreements, and other documents. Those docs pick the ground rules and set the board for the business game that follows.

The lawyers at the firm know their "flavor" of startup legal down cold. The 409A valuation firms they refer know where to look for the parts they need. The form financing documents they have ready to go are built to run on them. There may even be some document preparation automation going on back office.

A good form set produces a legally compliant, business-ready corporation every time. That is the vast majority of its value. But that isn't to say all form sets are created equal. They reflect the institutions that make them.

If a firm has particular strength in, say, tax, its startup forms may develop more nuanced tax features. If the firm forms a lot of startups for foreign founders, its forms may better address immigration needs. If the firm has an active form revision committee, or a particularly dedicated "startup" partner, updates for changes in the law may land quicker.

Conversely, if a firm's lawyers still close documents on paper, its forms will be drafted to work with that process. If the partners like _wherein_s and _whereas_es, their forms will be littered with them. If the firm cannot or does not devote significant time to revision and rewriting, the forms will grow tattered with ad hoc edits, tacked-on provisos, and other tool marks. If a firm's clients are uniformly alike in some way---say they mostly come through a particular accelerator---the forms may become specialized to that kind of client.

## The Law Firm Standard Distribution

It's not quite as bad as that. Fortunately, startup legal has had its BSD moment.

A number of very fine law firms now release snapshots of at least part of their in-house forms on the Internet. As far as I know, Orrick blazed the trail, followed eventually by Cooley, Gunderson, Perkins Coie, and probably others.

Anyone can download the latest Orrick/Cooley/Gunderson/PK Distribution. It may not be easy to use, complete, or up-to-date, but the community is better off for the information. It's good education for budding businesspeople. It's invaluable for up-and-coming lawyers. And if you're familiar with the forms---many startup lawyers can "recognize" a law firm in the style of a company's founding docs---it can even save you time reviewing for meaningful changes. As a practicing attorney, I've no doubt the process of preparing the forms for publication benefited the forms and the firms' own clients, too.

And they've seeded some meaningful innovation. The Orrick set, for example, begat Clerky, which in turn begat a bevy of startups. Gunderson's release of its documents on Docracy was a boon. Legal technology startups and open-source projects love to demo with startup documents, because they're just so easy to get.

## Over the Wall

The Law Firm Standard Distributions are fundamentally read-only. Each firm has its own internal revision process, and those processes are time-intensive and expensive. Their output alone is tremendously valuable, but there's no clear channel for outside feedback or interaction, and no good incentive for it to begin with. To land a patch upstream to the law firm, you go to work for the law firm and take it up to the committee or partner who tends the templates.

Of course, you're free to "fork" your own variant of a publicly released set. What happens next? Either you revisit each of your changes every time the firm makes a new release, or you give up and go your own way. The proliferation of "house" form sets at law firms may come down to lawyers carrying their old "house" set with them as they changed law firms. Even within firms that have standard form sets, lawyers are known to keep private variants for their own work.

This kind of diversification doesn't effectively distribute meaningful improvements to startups. It doesn't rapidly distribute fixes to problems, either. It definitely doesn't reduce the burden on those who review startup legal documents, such as for investor due diligence. It basically functions to keep effort as little consolidated as possible.

## "Open" is a Continuous Process

The startup community is waiting for a form set that:

1. runs all the old boring "business applications"
2. runs on modern process infrastructure, from document assembly to electronic signature, rather than law firm internal processes
3. releases in a transparent, predictable, and verifiable manner, for free, on the Internet
4. welcomes and acts on feedback, including "bug reports", from downstream users of all kinds

The Unix and startup stories diverge here. Startup legal doesn't require cleanroom rewriting to avoid a licensing issue. It doesn't need a port to a newer, cheaper, more universal platform. The community awaits an implementation that belongs to the community as a whole, rather than to any particular player, that is open, general, and adaptable enough for wide application.

Fundamentally, it's about process. A firm can standardize on documents that grow out of and mirror its own collaborative infrastructure and clientele. So can an accelerator. The tendency within such an environment is to optimize. The value of that optimization is real, but specializes the product to the organization. Underlying assumptions may not hold elsewhere, and may in fact work against inter-firm, inter-company adoption. In other words, against standardization.

The only precedent for that kind of standardization I'm aware of comes from industry groups. Finance has [an industry group that publishes standard forms](http://www.isda.org/). Insurance has [an industry group that publishes standard forms](http://iso.com). Even venture capitalists have [an industry group that publishes forms](http://nvca.org), though the law firms don't necessarily play along. 

There isn't a group representing the interests of startup companies. There ought to be. In its absence, what we have is competing, specialized implementations designed to lure new companies to one or another vendor of follow-on services, accountancy style. The answer is a state-of-the-art startup implementation developed with best-available tools for collaboration, promoted and refined by startups, for startups. When the construction industry got tired of the standard forms from the [architects' industry group](http://aia.org), they [started their own initiative](http://consensusdocs.org). Startups can do the same.
