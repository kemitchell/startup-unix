# Startup Legal is Unix

The legal structure of Silicon Valley-style startups is Unix all over again.

There are many flavors of startup legal docs. The major Silicon Valley law firms and some accelerators peddle house form sets. Just as you'd get [AIX](http://www.ibm.com/aix/) from IBM or [Solaris](http://oracle.com/solaris) from Sun, clients of, say, [Fenwick & West](http://fenwick.com) end up Fenwick-flavored startups, [Y Combinator](http://ycombinator.com) companies form as YC-flavored startups, and so on.

Lawyers who deal with startups recognize documents in the popular flavors. They pick a favorite for their own work, and its peculiars—down to section numbers and defined terms—burn into memory. Just as I will remember [`sudo apt-get install -y`](https://wiki.debian.org/Apt) until I die, the terms of the [Latham](http://lw.com)ite forms I trained on will always be familiar. I can certainly handle a [FreeBSD](http://freebsd.org) deployment or a [WSGR](http://wsgr.com)-founded startup, but I'll spend a little time reading manual pages and feeling my way around.

But familiarity aside, startup flavors still aren't "all the same". They differ meaningfully in style, organization, and features. They are products of different cultures. Updates appear with varying frequency from maintainers with different priorities, revised and released in different ways. Improvements crop up and spread, as with [DTrace](http://dtrace.org), so with forum bylaws. Vulnerabilities, like the infamous [Benchmark gap](http://www.goodwinprocter.com/~/media/Files/Publications/Attorney%20Articles/2002/The_Benchmark_Case_and_the_Limits_of_Preferred_Stock_Protections.pdf), get plugged.

The primary importance of compatibility unites the variations. The value of the banal, mission-critical legacy applications every startup has to run always overshadows any flavor-specific benefits. So if you've seen the word WHEREAS since starting your company, know you're are running legacy legal. But you probably won't tank because you couldn't issue options as new hires expect, make the reps investors want, or sell preferred without going to jail. We've all had a good laugh about the dusty, hulking mainframe in accounting, but the accounting seems to get done. And I hear they go to lunch with legal.

## The Law-Firm Startup Distribution

Fortunately, startup legal already has its [BSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution). A number of very fine law firms release snapshots of their in-house forms on the Web. As far as I know, [Orrick](https://www.orrick.com/practices/emerging-companies/startup-forms/) blazed that trail. [Cooley](https://www.cooleygo.com/) has followed. Docs used to travel as lawyers jumped ship to other law firms. Anyone with the Internet can get the latest Orrick Startup Distribution or Cooley Startup Distribution for free. It's easier to read up on those forms and spot deviations from them than forms that aren't published.

But each of the publicly released form sets is essentially read-only. Orrick begat Startup Library begat [Clerky](http://clerky.com) begat a bevy of startups. To land a patch to the Orrick forms, you work for Orrick, and you propose it to the forms committee or the partner or the paralegal who tends the master templates. Or you leave Orrick and start a company, like the Clerky guys. Whatever original changes you make, you have to rebase on every new release from Orrick. Or you just sell old forms.
